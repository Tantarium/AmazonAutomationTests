# AmazonAutomationTests
This is a suite of Automation tests for running through the Amazon webpage.
The goal of this task was to re-familiarize myself with Ruby Cucumber and Selenium 
as well as brush up on my Ruby skills.

The tests will run through searching for an item, adding items to the shopping cart, 
manipulating items in the shopping cart, and going through the process to purchase
items (though this will not actually purchase items).
